SQL DB File is in the DB Files folder of the project and will also be added as a standalone copy in the first layer 
of the Submission file. Please note that you may need to delete our old Database first.

Current Missing Features:

	Report generating for Admin.
		We didn't have time to finish this as we wanted to make sure the minimum requirements 
		were met, and due to time constraints. We left it for the final submission deadline as a result, 
		but the tab page can be found on the Patient Records form. All we have left is to add the report viewer,
		then have it linked to the SP of the last semester so that the information is generated in the report correctly.
		
	Adding Specialties to Doctors:
		This was something we decided to push back each iteration. It was never a main requirement, so we pushed it back 
		as we got more ambitious with each other requirement. We quickly realized that, as each of us has a job and life 
		outside of the course, adding it in with the little time we did have to complete the main requirements wouldn't be 
		a feasible possibility. 
		
	Adding Admin Approval/Disapproval of Doctor Specialties
		The reasonings behind this are the same as above, compounded by the fact that we didn't implement specialties to 
		begin with.
		
	Allowing the Setting of When a Test Should Be Preformed
		We decided this was best changed to allow the input of information of the tests, and the date would be set to 
		whenever that update was made. It is less of a non-implemented feature, and more of an evolution of one.
		
	Have a Printable Form of Treatments and Prescriptions
		This is another victim of life getting in our way. We originally planned for this to be a major feature; something 
		to make us stand out from the rest of the groups. Unfortunately, it very quickly became a low priority for us. We 
		have decided that it will be the last feature, possibly even one we can't finish in time, but that was something we 
		intended to speak to you about after a meeting with one another. We haven't given up hope on it, and we do have a 
		rough plan and some saved code hidden away.
