Known Bugs:

	Patient Records: This is less of a bug, and more of a comment. A user can order lab tests after an appointment has passed, along with 
		routine checkup information. That said, we left the possibility open as often the need to correct information is important. If 
		a nurse accidentally stated that the patient's weight was 12, not 120, the need to correct that is important. That is one of the 
		reasons we left the ability to edit the appointment, but not cancel it, after the appointment had passed available.
